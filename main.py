Creating a predictive maintenance tool for vehicles using machine learning is a multi-step process involving data collection, preprocessing, model training, and prediction. This example demonstrates a simplified version of such a tool using a hypothetical dataset. The code includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction phases with added comments and basic error handling.

### Key Components:

- **Logging and Error Handling**: The program uses Python's logging module to log informational messages and error messages to help in debugging. Basic error handling is introduced to manage common issues like file not found, empty file, or key errors during operations.
  
- **Loading Data**: The `load_data` function takes the file path of a CSV file and reads it into a Pandas DataFrame.

- **Preprocessing**: The `preprocess_data` function separates the features and target, and scales the features using the `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn.

- **Model Training**: The `train_model` function splits the data, trains a RandomForestClassifier, and evaluates its performance.

- **Running the Program**: The `main` function orchestrates loading, preprocessing, and model training. The if-statement at the bottom ensures the script runs only if it is the main program being executed.

### Additional Notes:

1. **Dataset**: Replace `'target'` with the appropriate target column in your dataset. Ensure the dataset is properly formatted with relevant features.

2. **Model**: RandomForestClassifier is a choice made for simplicity but might need adjustments based on the use case. More sophisticated models or tuning may be necessary for more accurate results.

3. **Enhancements**: Consider implementing more sophisticated error handling, logging configurations, model validation, and feature selection techniques for a robust application.

Before using this example, ensure the dataset matches the expected format, and the associated libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) are installed in your environment.
